### In this machine learning project, i solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions 
### using libraries numpy, scikit learn,  and few other python libraries. I overcome the problem by 
### creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques 
### to see which fits better. In this python machine learning project, I built a binary classifier
### using the Random Forest algorithm to detect credit card fraud transactions. Through this project,
### I understood and applied techniques to address the class imbalance issues and achieved 
### an accuracy of more than 99%.
